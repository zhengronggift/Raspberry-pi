***Tools: microSD card(8GB, I used 64GB because that's all I have, which is an overkill), a card reader, raspberry pi(2), HDMI cable, USB charger, keyboard, mouse, a laptop, Ethernet cable(optional).

Step one:
***Download latest Raspbian (or any lite operating system you want)
***Format the microSD on laptop. If use Window, use #guiformat. If Linux, check out Norman Dunbar's tutorial(http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/blog/2013/06/noobs-for-raspberry-pi/)
***Copy the Raspbian(or any OS) image to the microSD card. Use #Ethcher on Window. If Linux, check out above link.
***Plug the microSD card into Raspberry Pi, go for next step.

Step two:
***Find a TV, plug in the HDMI cable, connect it to Pi. Power up the Pi with USB charger connect to TV or laptop.
***Note that ssh is off by default, laptop is not needed for this step. There's a way to turn it on from laptop, but it takes time to get it right, so go get a TV or monitor.
***Connect the Pi with keyboard, mouse, and a ethernet cable to router.
***Turn the TV on, make sure it's in the right HDMI channel. Follow the step, the rasbian desktop will show up by the end.

Step three:
***In the Raspberry Pi Configuration, make sure ssh is turn on.
***Turn on Terminal(ctrl+alt+t), get updates and install vncserver(or update).
***Turn on VNC in the Raspberry Pi Configuration.

Step four:
***Sign up for a VNC account or sign in if you have one.
***Go to Raspberry Pi configuration, change the Resolution to 1080 or something bigger (depends on the PC monitor you going to code on)
***Save

Turn off, congratulation! You have a good working Pi now. 
You can access the Pi directly by using VNC viewer without HDMI cable.
